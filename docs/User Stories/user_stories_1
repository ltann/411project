Trending Feature
As a user who is new to stocks, I want to know the most trending companies within the app so that I can better analyze stock trends and make an informed decision on what new stocks to consider buying. After I log in successfully, I would see the most trending companies stock information within the app so that I can scroll through a list of trending stocks.
