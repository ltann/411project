For the front end, we chose React.js. We as a group were more familiar with the program, compared to our other option, Angular. One group member who hadnâ€™t used React before compared both of the technologies and noticed that Angular had a steeper learning curve to it than React did. That group member saw that it was easier for him to learn React than it was for all of us, who were unfamiliar with Angular, to learn Angular.

For the backend, we chose Node.js. We first discussed the technologies and frameworks that each group member had experience with. A majority of the group had experience with Node.js. One group member had familiarity with Django. We chose Node.js because a majority of the group were familiar with it so it would be a better idea for the one group member to familiarize themselves with Node.js rather than all the other group members learn Django. We also chose Node.js because it is faster than Django since Node.js is based on the fast and powerful Chrome v8 engine while Django is based on Python, an interpreted language.
